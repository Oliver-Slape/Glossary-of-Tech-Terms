<h2> SCRUM <h2>
<h3> 1. Product backlog <h3>
<h4> The product backlog is the requirements for a system, expressed as a prioritized list of product backlog items. These both include functional and non-functional requirements. It’s the responsibility of the product owner to prioritize the product backlog. <h4>
<h3> 2. Scrum Master <h3> 
<h4> The Scrum master is coordinator for the team and product owner. The Scrum Master doesn’t manage but rather work to assist both the team and the product owner in these ways:
Remove barriers between development and the product owner. Teach the product owner how to maximize return on investment and meet objectives through scrum. Improve the productivity of the development in any way possible. <h4>
<h3> 3. Sprint <h3>
<h4> A sprint is a section of the project time that is dedicated to an increment of the product functionality. This is a 30 day period which is longer than most agile methods however, a functional increment of the product must be completed at the end of the sprint. The sprint starts with one day planning for the sprint, daily scrum meetings occur during the sprint and the sprint is ended with a sprint review and retrospective. <h4>
<h3> 4. Sprint Backlog <h3>
<h4> The Sprint Backlog defines the work required for the sprint in a set of goals to be completed from the Product Backlog. <h4> 

<h2> Programming <h2>

<h3> Algorithm <h3>
<h4> A Process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations. <h4> 

<h3> Procedural paradigm <h3>
<h4> Procedures, also known as subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. Essentially it carries out the code of a program from function to function much like an algorithm. <h4> 

<h3> Event Driven paradigm <h3>
<h4> The flow of the program is controlled by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads. Essentially many things can happen at any moment based on events controlled by the program or user input; if this happens do that etc.. <h4>

<h3> Object Orientated paradigm <h3>
<h4> Based on the concept of 'Objects', which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. OOP features object's that can access and modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. OOP programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one and other. The main characteristics of OOP is separating code based on Class definitions, Objects and Class libraries. OOP puts emphasis on data of objects and code rather than procedure.<h4>

<h3> Relationship Between paradigms <h3>
<h4> All of the paradigms are trying to achieve the same outcome. They all help implement some form of solution to a problem, the differences are how they do it. They all contain functions but have different ways of them being implemented. Procedural simply just calls the functions, Event Driven ties the function to an event to happen and Object Orientated ties the function to an object through class and other methods. <h3>
